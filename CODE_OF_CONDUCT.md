# Virtual Coffee Code of Conduct

This project has adopted the [Virtual Coffee Code of Conduct](https://virtualcoffee.io/code-of-conduct/). 

As an Open Source Community, Virtual Coffee recognizes the importance of supporting our members and creating clear paths of communication. We know that sometimes things get lost in translation and we want to assume positive intent. 

With that said, if you believe someone has violated the Code of Conduct, please fill out our [COC Violation Form](https://virtualcoffee.io/report-coc-violation/), which you can do anonymously.

For more information, see the full [Virtual Coffee Code of Conduct](https://virtualcoffee.io/code-of-conduct/), or contact hello@virtualcoffee.io with any additional questions or comments.
