        When posting your answers, you can save members from being spoiled by wrapping your code in the following:

            <details>
            <summary>Description – <strong>score {characters}</strong></summary><br />
            <!-- Has to be followed by an empty line! -->

            ```html
            Your CSSBattles.dev code here!
            ```
            </details>

        This will result in a nice hidden bit like so:

        <details>
        <summary>Description – <strong>score {characters}</strong></summary><br />
        <!-- Has to be followed by an empty line! -->

        ```html
        Your CSSBattles.dev code here!
        ```
        </details>

        Feel free to copy/paste the above code into a comment!
